## Folding@home (Nosana template)

Folding@home is a distributed computing project that uses volunteers' CPUs and GPUs to run molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations help researchers study how proteins move and fold, which is critical for understanding and developing treatments for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and viral infections.

### How Folding@home works
- A lightweight client securely downloads small simulation tasks ("work units") from Folding@home servers.
- Your machine computes the simulation on CPU and/or GPU and periodically checkpoints progress.
- Results are uploaded back to the Folding@home network and aggregated with thousands of other contributions to power real scientific studies.
